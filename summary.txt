Regarding NLP and AI I have build an LLM for character level text-generation from scratch using libraries such as PyTorch, and Nmap. It is built on the basis on transformer decoder method, utilises self attention, positional encoding, Layer normalization and skip connections. It also used NLP techniques such as Tokenization, Language modelling, Token embedding, Multi-Head attention, utilising contextual representation, and English linguistic concepts. Along with this architecture, I have implemented CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and docker.
